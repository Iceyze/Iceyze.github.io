                    <u>The West won due to the theory of mercantilism, the Industrial Revolution's ability to produce on a large scale production, and the Rest's inability to catch up with modern technologies.</u> With mercantilism, Europeans would maximize their profits by increasing exports and decreasing imports. To do this, European powers sponsored exploration to find new trade markets (MacFarlane). On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered America bringing wealth back to Europe. This discovery incentivized the colonization of the New World. The Rest had no interest in the New World as the majority of global wealth was still held in the Old World (Asia, Europe, and Africa). Europeans expanded throughout what were once unimportant territories and brought trade with them making European powers wealthy. They would gain wealth in these new territories by exploiting natives to make the most profit out of exports employing slavery (Rodriguez). The Rest still utilized outdated trading by not colonizing new lands to maximize profit.

                    The Industrial Revolution's ability to mass-produce textiles made the English economy thrive. Industrialization leads the economies of the West to rise far above the Rest (Curth). As shown in the chart below, the West overtook the Rest economically in 1810 with its ability to produce and manufacture goods using industrial methods such as factories and steam-powered machines. The Industrial Revolution also brought about steam-powered transportation which made previously month-long trips only take a few weeks allowing for easy and fast transportation of resources, goods, and ideas (Curth).

                    The Rest already dominating the global economy saw no reason to catch up with western industrialization or their imperialistic ideas. The graph above shows how far ahead the rest already was of europe. They dominated global trade pre industrial revolution due to there large population and vast territories. Their military was underdeveloped due to the lack of war within the rest. Due to these issues the Europeans easily took control of parts of asia without any real resistance such as the city of Hong Kong which was taken from the Chinese in the First Opium War.
